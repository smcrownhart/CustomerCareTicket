# CustomerCareTicket

This is an attempt at a Customer Care Ticket. Not all features work. I still do not think I was appropriately adding my api to connect to the database as getAllTickets would not entirely read the database. 

In my datatbase, the most basic information we would use at my current job is in there. If I were to continue this, I would also create another table for the order in question. More often than not, customers are not contacted via email. They are called and their information is stored by phone number.
